# Daily dose of Advice

This is a small project that I made in a course of this day. Got to work with APIs and get to know them better.
Technologies that I used here are:
- HTLM, CSS, JS
- Vite + React

Thanks to Frontend Mentor website that provided me with the materials for this small project. I hope you enjoy itðŸ˜Š
